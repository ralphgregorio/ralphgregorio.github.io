I"@<p>I worked with the walkabilly lab to help develop their BEAP Engine. The Built Environment and
Active Populations (BEAP) Engine, a web application/tool we developed to collect, process and
analyze physical activity data exported from Apple Watch and Fitbit devices(As a value add,) the
tool also predicts past physical activity (from metrics such as energy expenditure and distance
walked) using machine learning methods, and returns the file in a more user-friendly format</p>
