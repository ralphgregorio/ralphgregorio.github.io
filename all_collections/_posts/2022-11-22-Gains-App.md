One of my first attempts at making a cross platform mobile app. This app is a simple workout tracker that lets a user log workouts, create and track their workouts.

It is a simple implementation to explore mobile development and the nuances of different applications. Unfortunately, I had made the decision to abandon this project due
to spending my time to learn Swift and Objective C instead of relying on react-native.
